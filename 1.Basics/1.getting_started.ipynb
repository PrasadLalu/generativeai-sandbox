       "AIMessage(content='Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models and algorithms that can create new content, such as text, images, music, and other forms of media, by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which is typically focused on recognizing patterns or making predictions based on input data, generative AI aims to generate new, original outputs that mimic the characteristics of the training data.\\n\\nThere are several key components and techniques associated with generative AI:\\n\\n1. **Models**: Common models used in generative AI include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and more recently, transformer-based architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for text generation and DALL-E for image generation.\\n\\n2. **Training**: Generative AI models are trained on large datasets to learn the underlying structures and distributions of the data. For instance, a text-based model might be trained on a vast corpus of written material to understand grammar, style, and factual information.\\n\\n3. **Applications**: Generative AI has a wide range of applications, including:\\n   - Text generation (e.g., writing stories, articles, or code)\\n   - Image generation (e.g., creating artwork, photos, or design models)\\n   - Music composition\\n   - Video synthesis\\n   - Gaming and virtual environments\\n\\n4. **Creativity and Personalization**: Generative AI can be used to enhance creativity, enabling users to produce unique content that would be time-consuming or difficult to create manually. It can also be leveraged for personalized content, catering to individual preferences and tastes.\\n\\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The rise of generative AI raises important ethical questions, such as concerns about copyright infringement, misinformation, deepfakes, and the potential for misuse in various contexts.\\n\\nOverall, generative AI represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to not only analyze data but also to contribute creatively by producing novel outputs.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 400, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 413, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_34a54ae93c', 'id': 'chatcmpl-Bq0iVMt80jvuHnC5F96bDgx4PO9NE', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--b842cecb-7b52-4eda-8515-0537a26b1615-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 400, 'total_tokens': 413, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"

See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nTo install LangChain run:\\n\\nPipCondapip install langchainconda install langchain -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=\"default\" # or any other project name\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport ostry:    # load environment variables from .env file (requires `python-dotenv`)    from dotenv import load_dotenv    load_dotenv()except ImportError:    passos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"if \"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\" not in os.environ:    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(        prompt=\"Enter your LangSmith API key (optional): \"    )if \"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\" not in os.environ:    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = getpass.getpass(        prompt=\\'Enter your LangSmith Project Name (default = \"default\"): \\'    )    if not os.environ.get(\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"):        os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = \"default\"\\nUsing Language Models\\u200b\\nFirst up, let\\'s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably. For details on getting started with a specific model, refer to supported integrations.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect chat model:Google Gemini▾OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiGoogle VertexAWSGroqCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIPerplexitypip install -qU \"langchain[google-genai]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for Google Gemini: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelmodel = init_chat_model(\"gemini-2.0-flash\", model_provider=\"google_genai\")\\nLet\\'s first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain Runnables, which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessagemessages = [    SystemMessage(\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"),    HumanMessage(\"hi!\"),]model.invoke(messages)API Reference:HumanMessage | SystemMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Ciao!\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 3, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 20, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 20, \\'output_tokens\\': 3, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\ntipIf we\\'ve enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the LangSmith trace. The LangSmith trace reports token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nNote that ChatModels receive message objects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational roles and hold important data, such as tool calls and token usage counts.\\nLangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or OpenAI format. The following are equivalent:\\nmodel.invoke(\"Hello\")model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}])model.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])\\nStreaming\\u200b\\nBecause chat models are Runnables, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\\nfor token in model.stream(messages):    print(token.content, end=\"|\")\\n|C|iao|!||\\nYou can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in this guide.\\nPrompt Templates\\u200b\\nRight now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\\nLet\\'s create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\\n\\nlanguage: The language to translate text into\\ntext: The text to translate\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_template = \"Translate the following from English into {language}\"prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [(\"system\", system_template), (\"user\", \"{text}\")])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\\nNote that ChatPromptTemplate supports multiple message roles in a single template. We format the language parameter into the system message, and the user text into a user message.\\nThe input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\\nprompt = prompt_template.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"hi!\"})prompt\\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\\nWe can see that it returns a ChatPromptValue that consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\\nprompt.to_messages()\\n[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nFinally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\\nresponse = model.invoke(prompt)print(response.content)\\nCiao!\\ntipMessage content can contain both text and content blocks with additional structure. See this guide for more information.\\nIf we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nThat\\'s it! In this tutorial you\\'ve learned how to create your first simple LLM application. You\\'ve learned how to work with language models, how to create a prompt template, and how to get great observability into applications you create with LangSmith.\\nThis just scratches the surface of what you will want to learn to become a proficient AI Engineer.

Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation.
